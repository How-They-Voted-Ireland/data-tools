# Data Tools
Tools to pull and transform the data from the [Oireachtas API](https://api.oireachtas.ie/).

## Approach
Cron job runs deploy/nightly each week night at 23:30. This script:

1. Retrieves all votes for a given `startDate` and `endDate` period (format `yyyy-mm-dd`)
2. Iterates over the results, using the `contextDate` value to retrieve the corresponding XML document for that day's activity. Currently, 31<sup>st</sup> August 2020, the API is broken for pulling XML for individual debates. The URL to pull the full day's data is `https://data.oireachtas.ie/akn/ie/debateRecord/dail/${contextDate}/debate/mul@/main.xml`
3. This XML document contains the data for that day - speeches, votes, results, and related data. The document can be relatively large (for example, the XML document for 2020-07-30 is 1MB in size), and parsing is not trivial

### Parsing the XML document
Near the top of the XML data there is:

```xml
 <analysis source="#source">
    <parliamentary>
        <voting eId="vote_37" href="#sum_34" outcome="#lost" refersTo="#sum_33">
            <count eId="vote_37-count_1" href="#qty_1" refersTo="#ta" value="52"/>
            <count eId="vote_37-count_2" href="#qty_2" refersTo="#nil" value="67"/>
            <count eId="vote_37-count_3" href="#qty_3" refersTo="#staon" value="0"/>
        </voting>
        <voting eId="vote_38" href="#sum_42" outcome="#lost" refersTo="#sum_41">
            <count eId="vote_38-count_1" href="#qty_4" refersTo="#ta" value="57"/>
            <count eId="vote_38-count_2" href="#qty_5" refersTo="#nil" value="72"/>
            <count eId="vote_38-count_3" href="#qty_6" refersTo="#staon" value="0"/>
        </voting>
        <voting eId="vote_39" href="#sum_49" outcome="#lost" refersTo="#sum_48">
            <count eId="vote_39-count_1" href="#qty_7" refersTo="#ta" value="58"/>
            <count eId="vote_39-count_2" href="#qty_8" refersTo="#nil" value="77"/>
            <count eId="vote_39-count_3" href="#qty_9" refersTo="#staon" value="0"/>
        </voting>
```

This looks like a summary of all the votes for that day and I can use the href and refersTo attributes to find all the appopriate info.

For example following the `refersTo` for the first vote above `refersTo="#sum_33"` I can get the vote details - outcome and who voted.

This section starts with:

```xml
<debateSection name="division" refersTo="#bill.2020.17.dail." eId="dbsect_24">
	<summary eId="sum_33">Amendment put: </summary>
	<summary title="division" eId="sum_34">The Committee divided: TÃ¡, 
	    <quantity refersTo="#ta" normalized="52" eId="qty_1">52</quanti
```

The `refersTo` here, `bill.2020.17.dail.`, can be used to find the debate.

```xml
<debateSection name="debate" refersTo="#bill.2020.17.dail.3_sub" eId="dbsect_23">
    <heading>Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020: Committee and Remaining Stages
        <recordedTime time="2020-07-30T15:20:00+01:00"/>
    </heading>
    <summary eId="sum_31"> Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</summary>
```

This contains the full text of the debate and other details.
